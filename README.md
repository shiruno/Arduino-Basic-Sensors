This code effectively creates a simple temperature and light monitoring system. The user can set a temperature threshold using a potentiometer, and if the measured temperature exceeds this threshold, the buzzer will sound at a frequency that varies based on the light level detected by the LDR. The system also provides real-time feedback through the Serial Monitor.
